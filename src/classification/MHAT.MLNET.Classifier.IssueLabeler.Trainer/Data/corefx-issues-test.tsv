27411	area-System.Net	Re-enable initlocals clearing in System.Net.Sockets on Unix	We disabled it because some ReceiveMessageFrom tests were failing.  The issue turned out to be that we weren't explicitly clearing an IPPacketInformation struct before handing it to native code, and the native code wasn't clearing it.  This fixes that (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27411/files#diff-74b2e83ee829756a9dc8177b5154b7f7R50).  Along with it, I initialized a few other variables, just for good measure.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27392  cc: @erozenfeld, @geoffkizer 
27410	area-System.Memory	Use TrailingZeroCount rather than LocateLastFoundByte	`Bmi1.TrailingZeroCount` isn't currently supported; so can't test, so this is mostly for feedback  ```csharp  return i * 8 + (int)Bmi1.TrailingZeroCount(candidate) >> 3;  ```  Using `LeadingZeroCount` ended up more instructions than the current flow  ```csharp  return i * 8 + (int)(((match ^ (match - 1)) * XorPowerOfTwoToHighByte) >> 57)  ```  Changing multiply to Lzcnt and subtraction  ```csharp  return i * 8 + (63 - (int)Lzcnt.LeadingZeroCount((candidate ^ (candidate - 1)))) >> 3;  ```    /cc @fiigii @tannergooding
27407	area-System.Net	Fix ManagedWebSocket cancellation race condition	When a cancelable cancellation token is passed to Receive/SendAsync, the code registers with the token to abort the web socket.  The resulting exception is then translated into an OperationCanceledException if _abort is true.  But this logic doesn't count on the possibility that the underlying Read/WriteAsync on the transport stream could actually throw a cancellation exception.  If it does, there's a race condition as to whether the web socket's abort flag will be set in time; if it is, we wrap the cancellation exception in another cancellation exception, and if it's not, we treat it as a non-cancellation exception.  This commit fixes that, by explicitly allowing OperationCanceledExceptions to proceed uninterrupted.  This should fix the ReceiveAsync_AfterCancellationDoReceiveAsync_ThrowsWebSocketException test, which recently started failing sporadically, I believe because we improved the cancellation support in SocketsHttpHandler, on top of which ClientWebSocket now sits.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27406  cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @wfurt, @anurse

27405	area-System.Security	X509Certificate2Collection.Find() does not return the same certificates as full framework	Hi,    I have a strange issue with handling of certificates from the windows certificate store. On full .NET framework, this code returns the expected certificates, on dotnet core, the very same code does not return any certificates from the store.    The code is the following:    ```  var certificates = new List<X509Certificate2>();    using (var myStore = new X509Store(StoreName.My, StoreLocation.CurrentUser))  {   myStore.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);   var certsWithCorrectUsage = myStore.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByKeyUsage, X509KeyUsageFlags.DataEncipherment.ToString(), true);     foreach (var cert in certsWithCorrectUsage)   {    if (cert.HasPrivateKey)    {     certificates.Add(cert);    }   }  }    return certificates;  ```    When debugging into the `.Find()` method I get down into `FindPal.VerifyCertificateIgnoringErrors()`, and there on the `chainPal.ChainStatus` I see the following error messages:  ```  The signature of the certificate cannot be verified.  A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the tust provider.  ```    I used the following powershell script to generate a root certificate, install it in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and create two other test certificates which are signed by this root cert:    [createcerts.ps1.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1751455/createcerts.ps1.txt)    Why doesn't the code on dotnet core find the root certificate, while it obviously seems to be trusted by my machine and also the full framework finds these certificates as valid for the requested purpose.
27403	area-System.Memory	Add GetPosition overload to ReadOnlySequence that only takes an int/long	Today GetPosition requires a relative offset but there are scenarios where you just want to get the position from the start. Today that looks like:    ```C#  // Get position 100  var position = sequence.GetPosition(sequence.Start, 100);  ```    ## Proposal    Add GetPosition that takes an int/long that assumes sequence.Start is the origin:    ```C#  var position = sequence.GetPosition(100);  ```    /cc @pakrym @KrzysztofCwalina @ahsonkhan @terrajobst @halter73

27396	area-Serialization	Support NegativeInfinity and PositiveInfinity as default value in sgen	Make the similar fix as #19724 for NegativeInfinity  and PositiveInfinity 
27395	area-System.Security	Add CU\My to the search path for resolving cert chains on Linux	No test is being committed because it requires editing the user's CU\My store, which doesn't make me happy.  This was tested by taking the CertificateRequest chain tests, saving the created intermediate to CU\My, removing the intermediate from ExtraStore, and then removing them at the end of the test.    After the test succeeded on Windows (and failed on Linux), the fix was made on the Linux chain builder driver.    Fixes #26020.
27394	area-System.Security	Enable RSA-OAEP(SHA-2) and RSA-PSS on Unix systems	This change provides an implementation of the OAEP padding algorithm and  the PSS encoding and verification routines in managed code. On the platforms  where we currently lack support for SHA-2-based OAEP and/or PSS the  managed implementation will be used in conjunction with the native layer in  a pre-padded operational context.    The suite of tests which were added uncovered other bugs which are being  addressed in this change, as well.  Mainly that RSACng and  RSASecurityTransforms both failed at encrypting zero-length data.  To solve  that problem the RSA padding class can build PKCS#1 encryption padding,  but since the native layers are capable of correctly decrypting the payloads  no unpadding code is needed at this time.    Fixes #2522  Fixes #2523  Fixes #27120

27383	area-System.Net	Split up cookie headers that are added via HttpListenerResponse.WebHeaders.Add	"This fixes an inconsistency between the Windows and Managed implementation of  HttpListenerResponse.    Basically, there are two ways to add cookies to an HttpListenerResponse. The 'usual' way is to add them to the cookie collection:  ```  response.Cookies = cookies;  ```  On Unix and on Windows that yields the following Set-Cookie header:  ```  Set-Cookie: name1=value1, name2=value2  ```  In this case though the user is setting the headers by adding them directly:  ```  foreach (var c in cookies)  {      HttpListenerResponse.Headers.Add(""Set-Cookie"",c);  }  ```  According to the relevant documentation for WebHeaderCollection.Add headers added more than once will be added in a comma separated list. So, even adding the headers directly, we expect the same result. That is true on Unix, and we get the following header:  ```  Set-Cookie: name1=value1,name2=value2  ```  However, on Windows we see an unexpected result:  ```  Set-Cookie: name1=value1  Set-Cookie: name2=value2  ```  While both behaviors are acceptable, I think that the Windows behavior was intentionally added. That is based off of this comment in the relevant code:  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/3db29b721a45fb4f300e27c5df5750f57b38ec45/src/System.Net.HttpListener/src/System/Net/Windows/HttpListenerResponse.Windows.cs#L460-L482  This PR ensures that the managed implementation follows the same behavior as the Windows version. I think that should also update the documentation to reflect this behavior, since it seems to be by design.    Fixes: #22910 "
27382	area-System.Net	Use SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO with SystemDefaults	"The current SslStream implementation was applying SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO only when TLS1.2, TLS1.1 and/or TLS1.0 flags were set.   In .NET Core 2.0, we introduced a new TLS option (#13075), called 'SystemDefault', which means to use the best (strongest) TLS security   protocol available in the operating system. But since SystemDefault (equal to all flag bits set to zero) doesn't match any of the TLS bit   masks, we weren't passing in the SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag.    This fix adds a check for SystemDefault and makes sure that the SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag is passed to SCHANNEL.  According to the SCHANNEL experts, the current ""SystemDefault' will actually use strong crypto settings on current Windows OS's.   But they advised us that we should always pass in the SCH_USE_STRONG_CRYPTO flag when using 'SystemDefault'.    This is related to internal bug 458042."

27360	area-System.Net	Fix fragment handling in HttpClient	SocketsHttpHandler isn't sending fragments, nor is it properly inheriting the fragment from the original request URI into the redirect location URI when the original URI had one and the redirect URI did not, even though RFC 7231 says it must.  This commit fixes that for SocketsHttpHandler.    WinHttpHandler also isn't handling this inheritance according to the RFC. It appears that the logic for WinHttpHandler would actually need to be changed in WINHTTP itself, or else WinHttpHandler would need to be changed to do the redirects itself.    Neither CurlHandler or NetFxHandler send fragments at all.    This commit also fixes the test to correctly compare the expected and actual Uris... apparently Uri equality doesn't factor in fragments, so they're first converted to strings.  It also updates the test to also validate that the server received the URI with the fragment included.    Closes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27305  cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @wfurt, @rmkerr 
27358	area-System.Security	X509Certificate2 unclear error message when attempting to store certificate in non-existent store	"Had a problem where my app would work fine locally, but fail when hosted on azure app services.    I was trying to load a certificate from a file using ```new X509Certificate2(string fileName, string password)```. (Although hrom cursory research the error message is identically as ambiguous with other construction methods)    The error message I received was:  ```  Unhandled Exception: Internal.Cryptography.CryptoThrowHelper+WindowsCryptographicException: The system cannot find the file specified     at Internal.Cryptography.Pal.CertificatePal.FromBlobOrFile(Byte[] rawData, String fileName, String password, X509KeyStorageFlags keyStorageFlags)     at System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate..ctor(String fileName, String password, X509KeyStorageFlags keyStorageFlags)     at System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2..ctor(String fileName)     at ConsoleApplication.Program.Main(String[] args)  ```    The certificate was, indeed, present and was readable from the user running - so it's not an issue that the certificate can't be found!    The actual error is, I believe, that it can't put the certificate the LocalUser's cert store. Info [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20151101033040/http://blog.tylerdoerksen.com:80/2013/08/23/pfx-certificate-files-and-windows-azure-websites/).    I think the culprit is here  https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/29cd6a0b0ac2993cee23ebaf36ca3d4bce6dd75f/src/System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates/src/Internal/Cryptography/Pal.Windows/CertificatePal.Import.cs#L150-L152    I believe the last hresult from PFXImportCertStore will be CRYPT_E_NOT_FOUND  ""can't find file"". Which causes ambiguity between ""can't find the given certificate file to import"" and ""got an error when trying to put the certificate after trying to put it in a store"".    Not sure how you'd go about solving this as we're only returned CRYPT_E_NOT_FOUND for failed imports regardless of reason.    Repro:  1. Create a web app that pulls a certificate from a file  2. ```new X509Certificate2(string fileName, string password)```  3. Upload and run on azure app services  4. Pull hair out for 2h wondering why it can't find a file that blatantly exists.    Workaround:  Store it in the MachineKey set  ```new X509Certificate2(filePath,  pass, X509KeyStorageFlags.MachineKeySet);```"

27355	area-System.Net	HttpWebRequest/HttpWebResponse never releases connection after http server error (.Net Core 2.0.1, Debian 8)	"I'm running a .Net Core Console App under Debian 8, which constantly queries a REST server via HTTPS.  The app uses plain syncronous http calls using HttpWebRequest / HttpWebResponse .  I noticed that after some hours of operation all calls raise exceptions with description ""Too many open files"", meaning that there are too many connections left non-closed.  After some investigation I figured out that each time the http server responds with non-200 status code (for example, 5хх server errors of 429 Too many requests), even after disposing HttpWebResponse the connection remains open but is never reused by ServicePoint manager for next HttpWebRequest, even for the same host/URL. After a significant amount of errors the open file limit (default 4096) is exhausted an no further requests are possible. The connections are never released until the dotnet process is killed.    Actions to reproduce he problem:    1. I wrote a simple php script `getstatus.php` and placed it on a test web serer. The script emulates http error. It accepts a numeric code as GET query and responds with same HTTP code. The response body always  contains the same - the resquest headers. When requesting `https://myserver/getstatus.php` or  `https://myserver/getstaus.php?200` I get normal response. When requesting `https://myserver/getstaus.php?500` I get same content, but with 500 status code (""Internal server error"") etc.  The php code is below:  ```php  <?php  $code=$_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'];  if ($code) {   http_response_code($code);  };  echo ""Request headers:         <br /> \n"";  foreach (getallheaders() as $name => $value) {      echo ""$name: $value         <br />\n"";  }  ?>  ```    2. The sample vb.net code for quering the server. The program accepts a numeric code as argument and makes 100 requests to test server:    ```vb  Imports System  Imports System.IO  Imports System.Net  Imports System.Threading    Module Program      Private Const USER_AGENT = ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/64.0.3282.167 Safari/537.36""        Sub Main(args As String())          Dim result As String          For counter = 1 To 100              If args.Count < 1 Then                  Console.WriteLine(""Launched without arguments"")                  result = DownloadString(""https://mytestserver/getstatus.php"")              Else                  Console.WriteLine(""Launched with argument: {0}"", args(0))                  result = DownloadString(""https://mytestserver/getstatus.php?"" & args(0))              End If              Console.WriteLine(""Respone content > "" & result)              Thread.Sleep(500)          Next          Console.ReadLine()      End Sub        Private Function GetResult(ByRef w As HttpWebRequest) As String          Try              Using r As HttpWebResponse = w.GetResponse                  Console.WriteLine(""Response status > "" & r.StatusCode)                  Console.WriteLine(""Response headers > "" & r.Headers.ToString)                  Using s As Stream = r.GetResponseStream                      Using rd As StreamReader = New StreamReader(s)                          Dim st As String = rd.ReadToEnd                          Return st                      End Using                  End Using              End Using          Catch ex As webException              Console.WriteLine(""Catch in GetResult(): "" & ex.Message)          End Try        End Function        Private Function DownloadString(ByVal __Url As String) As String          Try              Dim w As HttpWebRequest = CType(WebRequest.Create(__Url), HttpWebRequest)              w.UserAgent = USER_AGENT              w.KeepAlive = True              w.Timeout = 10000              w.ReadWriteTimeout = 10000              Console.WriteLine(""Requesting "" & __Url)              Return GetResult(w)          Catch ex As Exception              Console.WriteLine(""Catch in DownloadString(): "" & ex.Message)          End Try      End Function    End Module  ```  I use VS 2017 Community to write the code. The project was created using a "".Net Core Console application"" template with no additional changes to project configuration. The target platform is shown as "".NET Core 2.0""  The project is compiled under VS, then published to a folder, then the folder contents are transferred to the Debian 8 machine (VPS) and run like `dotnet myproj.dll`    3. To count open file handles I use a bash script found on StackOverflow  ```bash  cd /proc  for pid in [0-9]*  do      echo ""PID = $pid with $(ls /proc/$pid/fd/ | wc -l) file descriptors""  done | sort -rn -k5 | head | while read -r _ _ pid _ fdcount _  do    command=$(ps -o cmd -p ""$pid"" -hc)    printf ""pid = %5d with %4d fds: %s\n"" ""$pid"" ""$fdcount"" ""$command""  done  ```    4. Actual testing  4.1. Run `dotnet myproj.dll`. On a separate session monitor open file count with the above script. In my case there are no more than 42 open files for the dotnet process, from start to finish.    4.2. Run `dotnet myproj.dll 500` emulating http errors. Each attempt to get httpwebresponse object results in exception which is logged to console. After each error the number of open files for dotnet process increases by 3 (!). After 100 ""unsuccessful"" requests the open file count reaches 344 (started at 42).  Note that all objects for response handling are wrapped in `using`, so they should be disposed properly after exception, and tcp connection should be released for reusing for next calls. I might be wrong, but current behavior is a bug.    During further experiments I found a workaround. If I completely read a ResponseStream of WebException.Response object, the connection seems to be released, and total connection count does not increse. The `Catch` block in `GetResponse` function should containg following lines:  ```vb  Catch ex As webException              Console.WriteLine(""Catch in GetResult(): "" & ex.Message)              Console.WriteLine(""WebException.Reponse.Headers: "" & ex.Response.Headers.ToString)              Using s As Stream = ex.Response.GetResponseStream                  Using rd As StreamReader = New StreamReader(s)                      Dim st As String = rd.ReadToEnd                      Return st                  End Using              End Using          End Try  ```  But this seems to be redundant because in many cases servers don't return any meaningful info after http error in the response body, so reading it is unneeded work and anyway non-intuinive way of programming.  Thanks for attention and please don't mind any mistakes, I'm not a professiona l programmer.                           "
27354	area-System.Net	SSL certificate validation on Windows 7 with .Net Framework is ignored after a connection to port different than 443 was established	"- Steps to reproduce:    1. Create/find a server that hosts 2 SSL endpoins on port 443 and port 10443 (probably any port different that 443) - the IP address of the two endpoints should be the same, the server certificates of the endpoints should be self-signed and different.  2. Build the following code for **net471**:  ```c#            static void Main(string[] args)          {             string host = ""your server IP"";             MakeRequest(host, 10443);             MakeRequest(host, 443);          }           private static void MakeRequest(string host, int port) {            HttpRequestMessage webRequest =               new HttpRequestMessage(                  HttpMethod.Get,                  $""https://{host}:{port}/"");            webRequest.Version = new Version(1, 1);              var handler = new HttpClientHandler {               ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback =                  (sender, cert, chain, errors) => true            };            HttpClient client = new HttpClient(handler);              client.SendAsync(webRequest).Wait();         }  ```  3. Run the following code to connect to that server **on Windows 7 64-bit**    - Expected result:  The code should complete without errors    - Actual result:  There is an exception:    ```  System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request.   System.Net.WebException: The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.  ```    **This does not reproduce on Windows 10.**    Considering that this API is part of the .Net Standard 2.0 API, it affects portable code running on Windows 7 and on .Net Framework.    The issue is also observed on all net451+ frameworks on Windows 7. The  test for those frameworks uses the ```WebRequestHandler``` as it is the only one that has a certificate validation support.    I think it has something to do with the ServicePointManager and it reusing of connections as reducing the MaxServicePointIdleTime seems to have some effect (though in the distilled repro above I couldn't make it pass).    If the order of the request is changed so that the connection to the port 443 is established first, then the connection to port 10443 is ok.  "
27352	area-System.Net	be more liberal on what exception type to get on handshake failure	on Ubuntu18 following tests were failing: (#27023)    - GetAsync_AllowedSSLVersionDiffersFromServer_ThrowsException (Tls11/Tls12 args)  - GetAsync_DisallowTls10_AllowTls11_AllowTls12    The both set mismatched TLS versions and they expect handshake to fail.   However newer openssl sends Alert message before shutting down TCP connection.  The existing test expected IO failure and failed because we got Exception from SSL handshake.     This change will accept either exception as successful test pass.   The handshake should fail  but that can happen in different ways.

27334	area-System.Runtime	StringBuilder should allow copying efficiently to a TextWriter	## Motivation    At present to copy a StringBuilder into a TextWriter you must allocate a throwaway string as large as the amount you want to copy. This can cause a LOH allocation.    ## Workaround     To avoid that today you must write code to copy in blocks via a char[] buffer. ASP.NET were forced to do this ([PR here](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebStack/commit/3fe0d348f00864e4f1eeaefbd027ea965787b892#diff-fe84a6b0645ee996bea1ec4d8445823f)) in response to an issue in a customer workload.    If we add an API for StringBuilder to copy to a TextWriter, we can take care of that loop, and also use a pooled char[].    ## Proposed API    ```c#      public sealed partial class StringBuilder : System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable      {           // existing          public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, char[] destination, int destinationIndex, int count) { }          public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, System.Span<char> destination, int count) { }            // proposed          public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, TextWriter destination, int count) { }      }  ```    ## Rough Implementation    Basically [what ASP.NET did](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetWebStack/blob/62d0b2df0bcca848a8e0848fd1866928df15528e/src/System.Web.WebPages/StringWriterExtensions.cs#L15) but using a pooled char[] buffer.    ```c#  public void CopyTo(int sourceIndex, TextWriter destination, int count)   {               int remainingChars = this.Length;              int bufferSize = Math.Min(this.Length,  1024);                char[] buffer = ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Rent(bufferSize);              int currentPosition = 0;                while (remainingChars > 0)              {                  int copyLen = Math.Min(bufferSize, remainingChars);                    this.CopyTo(currentPosition, buffer, copyLen);                    destination.Write(buffer, 0, copyLen);                    currentPosition += copyLen;                  remainingChars -= copyLen;              }               ArrayPool<byte>.Shared.Return(buffer);  }  ````

27324	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler may corrupt pooled connection if send content is canceled	When a connection is about to be returned to the pool, we're nulling out the _currentRequest field, which then causes the send content to stop sending if it's still going.

Should this attribute use the same regex validation method as its [Framework equivalent](https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource/blob/master/System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations/DataAnnotations/EmailAddressAttribute.cs#L54), which seems much more robust?

27304	area-System.Runtime	Check if app is run by sudo/admin on Linux	@maroallegro commented on [Mon Jan 29 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1244)  I am trying to check if .NetCore code is running as sudo/admin on Linux. It works on Windows but throws exception on Linux.    How do I check if app is run by admin/sudo on Ubuntu Linux by using .NET Core2.0 build-in class?    Here is the code I have tried (however i thought that it will not manage admin rights on Linux):  ```  using System;  using System.Security.Principal;    namespace smallTestsCore  {      class Program      {          static void Main(string[] args)          {              Console.WriteLine(Program.IsAdministrator);              Console.ReadLine();          }          public static bool IsAdministrator =>              new WindowsPrincipal(WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent())                  .IsInRole(WindowsBuiltInRole.Administrator);      }  }  ```  The code works on Windows, but does not work on Linux:    ```  Exception has occurred: CLR/System.PlatformNotSupportedException  An unhandled exception of type 'System.PlatformNotSupportedException' occurred in  System.Security.Principal.Windows.dll: 'Windows Principal functionality is not supported on this platform.'    at System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.GetCurrent()     at adminTst.Program.get_IsAdministrator() in /home/user/adminTst/Program.cs:line 15     at adminTst.Program.Main(String[] args) in /home/user/adminTst/Program.cs:line 11  ```

27299	area-System.ComponentModel	System.ComponentModel.Composition is missing a typeforward for Lazy<T,TMetadata>	"@joperezr and I noticed this when having a discussion.    System.ComponentModel.Composition reference assembly is missing a type-forward for System.Lazy<T, TMetadata>.    As a result, when you use a .NET assembly which makes use of this type and reference System.ComponentModel.Composition, you will see a compile error.    ```  Error CS0012 The type 'Lazy<,>' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'System.ComponentModel.Composition, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.  ```    See attached sample.  [LazySample.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1742137/LazySample.zip)    We should fix this by added the typeforward to the ref.     This also raises the question of  ""what goes in netcoreapp2.1""?  We can't remove System.ComponentModel.Composition.dll since that will be a breaking change.  It was present in 2.0 in order to typeforward this one type to System.Runtime.  Should we include all of MEF? /cc @weshaggard @danmosemsft   "

27295	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: should validate request after chained handlers execute	The code in `SocketsHttpHandler::ValidateAndNormalizeRequest` is performing some checks on request validity, e.g. don't allow chunked encoding if there's no content.    These checks happen before the chained handlers (redirect, auth, etc) execute.  Because of this, it's possible that one of these handlers could modify the request to be invalid.  (In fact, we hit this previously because the redirect handler was changing POST to GET and clearing content but not removing Transfer-Encoding: chunked.)    Just to be safe, we should at least consider moving the validation logic to execute after the chained handers run, but before we try to establish a connection.

This matches WinHttpHandler/CurlHandler.    This does not match full framework behavior, though.  Framework will simply stop redirecting and return the last 3xx response.    The latter seems slightly better to me.  However, it also means the user needs to handle this case and not assume a 200 response.  They pretty much have to do this anyway since the response could always be 4xx or 5xx anyway, but it's still one more situation for them to handle.

27279	area-System.IO	GZipStream cannot decompress multipart gzip files. 	"See the following [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47743788/gzipstream-from-memorystream-only-returns-a-few-hundred-bytes  ) for more information.    GZipStream currently fails if you try to decompress a concatenated gzip file. The RFC does state that two gzip files can be cated together and it is also a valid gzip file. However, the current implementation can only read the first gzip stream and stops there. Here is a simple repro::  ```cs  using System;  using System.IO;  using System.IO.Compression;  class Program  {      static void Main()      {          using (var fs = new FileStream(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory,""test.txt.gz""), FileMode.Create))          {              using(var gz = new GZipStream(fs, CompressionLevel.NoCompression, true))              using(var sw = new StreamWriter(gz))                  sw.WriteLine(""Stream 1"");                                using(var gz = new GZipStream(fs, CompressionLevel.NoCompression, true))              using(var sw = new StreamWriter(gz))                  sw.WriteLine(""Stream 2"");                            fs.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);              using (var gz = new GZipStream(fs, CompressionMode.Decompress))              using (var sr = new StreamReader(gz))              Console.WriteLine(sr.ReadToEnd());          }      }  }  ```    The expected output should be  ```  Stream 1  Stream 2  ```  But the actual output is just `Stream 1`.    If you open up ""test.txt.gz"" in your favorite gzip util, like 7z, you will be able to extract the file and you will see the correct output."

(double byte - 50MB file)  - There are 100MB of StringBuilder allocations.    ## API Proposal  ```csharp  namespace System.Text.RegularExpressions  {      public class Regex      {          // Returns amount of bytes written into the buffer          public static int Replace(ReadOnlySpan<char> input, Span<char> buffer, string pattern, string replacement, RegexOptions options = RegexOptions.None, TimeSpan matchTimeout = default);      }  }  ```    ## Notes  This API would help us remove unnecessary string allocations in the regex-redux benchmark (http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=regexredux&lang=csharpcore&id=9).  The Regex.Replace implementation uses Match internally to check the pattern on the input string. Can we also change the Match code to operate on Spans or do we need to allocate a string in that step?    ## Sample Usage  ```csharp  // Sample implementation for regex-redux  const int InputFileSize = 1024 * 1024 * 50; // 50 MB input file    // Borrow buffers   char[] buffer1Arr = ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Rent(InputFileSize);   char[] buffer2Arr = ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Rent(InputFileSize);   Span<char> buffer1 = new Span<char>(buffer1Arr);   Span<char> buffer2 = new Span<char>(buffer2Arr);    int bufferBytesWritten = Console.In.ReadBlock(buffer1);  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer1.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer2, ""tHa[Nt]"", ""<4>"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer2.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer1, ""aND|caN|Ha[DS]|WaS"", ""<3>"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer1.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer2, ""a[NSt]|BY"", ""<2>"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer2.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer1, ""<[^>]*>"", ""|"");  bufferBytesWritten = Regex.Replace(buffer1.Slice(0, bufferBytesWritten).AsReadOnlySpan(), buffer2, ""\\|[^|][^|]*\\|"", ""-"");    // Return buffers  ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Return(buffer1Arr);  ArrayPool<char>.Shared.Return(buffer2Arr);    return bufferBytesWritten;  ```    Relates to https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27124    cc @stephentoub @danmosemsft @vancem @jkotas @jfree"

I'd noticed in a project of mine that the `TextWriter` overload of `WebUtility.HtmlEncode` was unexpectedly generating garbage.    I added a `System.Buffers` project reference to the `System.Runtime.Extensions` csproj and wrote a simple implementation of `StringBuilder` based on `ArrayPool`, as suggested by @jkotas in https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/13875.

27246	area-System.IO	Add PipeReader and PipeWriter implementations over a Stream	This will help with adoption of pipelines. This is possible today but we can provide an implementation with minimal allocations. The usual adapter code involves creating 2 pipes and creating 2 async loops that read from the stream and write into the pipe and reading from the pipe and writing into the Stream.    This works well but there are some downsides:  - Some streams buffer internally and we may end up copying from the Stream's internal buffer into the pipe's buffers.  - Even if we can avoid that, we'll end up allocating a Task per read and write operation (though some streams cache the result of the previous operation)  - We end up paying per read/write costs in general (for e.g. in FileStream allocating via ThreadPoolBoundHandle.AllocateNativeOverlapped per read/write pair).    Most of the per read/write costs can be mitigated by using CopyToAsync (if overridden by the Stream) but there are some downsides there as well.  - Using the default implementations CopyToAsync allocates an internal buffer if the Stream doesn't have one already and passes that buffer to the other stream. Using the default pipe implementation, we end up copying the Stream's buffer into the pipe's buffer which might be fine but is a bit unfortunate.    We can avoid some of these overheads if we implement a PipeReader on top of CopyToAsync that doesn't use the Pipe internally. The idea here is that we call CopyToAsync on a fake stream that forwards WriteAsync calls to the PipeReader consumer. This implementation would pass buffers directly from the Stream to the consumer. If the consumer doesn't process the entire buffer, only the unconsumed buffer is copied into an internal buffer for the next read.    The write side isn't as problematic because we need to be able to allocate memory to write into the Stream so reusing the pipe isn't so bad here. The implementation here would likely be using a Pipe internally, then writing to the Stream on FlushAsync.
27245	area-System.Net	HttpContent auto-computed content length header is not exposed via header enumeration	"If you access HttpContent.Headers.ContentLength directly, we will attempt to use the content's TryComputeLength to construct a content length header.    However, if you access HttpContent.Headers via its enumerator or a method like TryGetValues, we won't construct the content length header.    This means that just accessing the ContentLength property will change the results of header enumeration.  For example:    ```csharp              var content = new StringContent(""hello world"");              foreach (var kvp in content.Headers) { }    // Content-Length not present              var ignore = content.Headers.ContentLength;              foreach (var kvp in content.Headers) { }    // Content-Length present  ```    Similarly, if you try to remove the header using the Remove method, it's not actually removed:    ```csharp              var content = new StringContent(""hello world"");              content.Headers.Remove(""Content-Length"");              Assert.Equal(null, content.Headers.ContentLength);  // fails; returns value from TryComputeLength  ```    The easiest fix here is probably just to try to compute the length when the content object is constructed.  This assumes that TryComputeLength is always cheap, which seems reasonable, but is slightly different than how it's used today.  Also, it seems like LoadIntoBufferAsync changes the Content-Length, but probably this is fine.    Unfortunately, fixing this will cause SocketsHttpHandler to behave incorrectly.  Currently, if you set TransferEncodingChunked = true, then SocketsHttpHandler will never access the ContentLength property directly, and thus it won't get populated and won't get sent on the wire.  Fixing the above behavior will cause the ContentLength to get populated, and thus sent on the wire, which is not correct behavior, per RFC.  So this will need to get fixed somehow.  (Note that this problem exists today, it's just harder to hit it -- you would need to either set Content-Length explicitly, or force population of the header by accessing it.)    (edited because I'm an idiot and can't read the RFC properly)  "

That way, if the server is unresponsive, we don't need to wait for the full HttpClient timeout to cancel the request, and conversely, setting a small HttpClient timeout to avoid such issues doesn't cancel an active operation taking a long time simply because it's conversing a lot.    We should add:  ```C#  public sealed class SocketsHttpHandler  {      public TimeSpan ConnectTimeout { get; set; } // defaults to infinite so that it's opt-in / pay for play      ...  }  ```
27234	area-Infrastructure	Consider making a property-based testing library available for tests.	Consider making a property-based testing library, such as [FsCheck](https://github.com/fscheck/FsCheck), available for use in testing.    In particular, [model-based testing](https://fscheck.github.io/FsCheck/StatefulTesting.html) would be useful for dealing with things like the [XML.LINQ](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Private.Xml.Linq/tests/events/EventsAdd.cs) property tests, making it easier to write combinatorial tests that search through more possibilities.    Now, it's true that FsCheck, like most libraries based on Quickcheck, normally use a random seed on each run; this is considered a feature.  However, they all explicitly include the failing seed for any failing test in the output, and this can be included in the config for the test (meaning regression tests can be automatically re-run)

Event is raised properly if we listen in `/tmp/realdir` instead.

That didn't happen though (no events being raised, I also tested with other event types).

27231	area-System.Net	Several perf improvements/tweaks for SocketsHttpHandler	- Chunked reads from buffer.  We now process as much of the buffer as we can synchronously during ReadAsync, rather than returning once we hit the end of a chunk.  For very small chunks that arrive quickly, this results in a huge perf increase, e.g. best case for the optimization, with lots of 1-byte chunks getting buffered together, it's now 10x faster.  With 100-byte chunks buffered together, it's 2x faster.    - Blitting byte[] to output for known headers.  Rather than using WriteStringAsync to output all header names, we now use WriteBytesAsync for known headers, with the headers precomputed into byte[]s and cached.    - Cached `Task<int>`s for ReadAsync.  Hopefully consumers start moving to the new `ReadAsync(Memory<byte>, CancellationToken)` overload on Stream, but for those who consume via `ReadAsync(byte[], int, int)`, we need to allocate a task even for synchronously completing values, which will be common when reading from a buffer.  We now cache `Task<int>`s for values < 1024, to account for small reads.    - Removed delegate/closure allocation from connection.  We were accidentally closing over a cancellation token, resulting in an extra delegate and closure allocation in ConnectHelper.  Also reduced the size of the EstablishSslConnectionAsync state machine by splitting the method in order to remove several arguments from being included.    - Use Utf8Formatter for hex values.  Switched from custom formatting of hex values to just use Utf8Formatter.TryFormat.    - Avoid buffering in HttpConnection.CopyToAsync(Stream).  This is used when we want to copy the whole source stream until EOF (e.g. for a Connection: close response), and thus we can skip the buffer and use the source stream's CopyToAsync directly.    - Added a test to exercise various size chunks, line endings, ReadAsync vs CopyToAsync, etc.    - Fix CopyToAsync cancellation handling.  Even though we'll abort the connection when cancellation is requested, we still need to pass the token to the destination stream's WriteAsync to give it the opportunity to cancel.  Also properly pass the buffer size through to the underlying stream's CopyToAsync where appropriate.    - Small miscellaneous cleanup, like removing a few unused arguments from methods, fixing an assert to validate the right thing, etc.    Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/27198  cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @wfurt, @Priya91

27227	area-System.Runtime	TimeZoneInfo incredibly slow	"The TimeZoneInfo methods ConvertTimeToUtc, IsAmbiguousTime and IsDayLightSavingTime popped up as eating up about half of the processing time in a program importing, converting and storing lots of data in a database, As this was quite unbelievable to me, I programmed a little converter, which did  these same conversions for our time zone ""W. Europe Standard Time"" and found it to be about 70 times as fast as the dotnet implementation.  I tried to figure out what went wrong in TimeZoneInfo implementation, but it looked pretty complicated (even messed up) to me, and as I only have limited time resources thought, that someone responsible for this code should check this out instead.   I know my comparison is only valid for our W.European timezone, but I think that most time zones are similarily easy to implement, so for these types of zones the dotnet code really should perform much better. Performance should really be an issue here, as time-related functionality is offen used in comination with engineering and measurment data, where converting between local timezones and UTC is very frequent, and needs to be fast.

27209	area-System.Security	Normalize names of span inputs in crypto API	"The asymmetric types operate on either hashed input, or unprocessed input.  The existing API tends to call hashed input ""hash"" (or ""rgbHash"" for older API),  and unprocessed input ""data"" (or ""rgbData"").    This change modifies the new (ReadOnly)Span-based methods to use ""data""  and ""hash"" (as appropriate) instead of ""source"".  Particularly because the  hash-based methods in DSA do not contain the word Hash, making ""source""  for CreateSignature ambiguous.    In the cases where the existing parameter was named ""rgbHash"" (et al) the  ""rgb"" was dropped in the (ReadOnly)Span variant, including in the cases  where the (ReadOnly)Span variant is a proper overload."

27198	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler: improve chunked read handling	Today, we only use a single chunk per ReadAsync on the content body.  For example, if we receive a chunked response body like this:    ```  5\r\n  hello\r\n  5\r\n  world\r\n  0\r\n  ```    The first ReadAsync on the response stream will only get the first 5 bytes, even though more bytes are available in subsequent chunks.    We should improve this.  We should process as many chunks are available in the buffer before returning to the user.    Addditionally, we should consider doing a buffered read when we are close to the end of the chunk but haven't fully chunk yet.  For example, assume the initial read on the body causes us to read into the connection read buffer, receiving the following chunks, with the second one incomplete:    ```  5\r\n  hello\r\n  5\r\n  wo  ```    Per above, for the initial read, we should process both chunks and return 7 bytes.    For the next read, we should notice that we are close to the end of the chunk (3 bytes remaining) and do a buffered read on the connection.  This will allow us to process the rest of the current chunk and any additional chunks returned as part of the buffered read.    We should only do unbuffered reads when there are enough bytes remaining in the current chunk to satisfy the requested read size, unless the remaining chunk bytes won't fit in the connection read buffer, in which case we should do an unbuffered read up to the remaining chunk bytes.

There's no easy way to know if a given Platform supports this apart from either hardcoding a list of Platforms, or trying to do it and catching the Exception.    Streams have methods like CanRead/CanWrite/CanSeek to allow developers to verify if something _could_ work before doing it.    I'd like to propose a new static property on FileStream named like `SupportsLocking` than can be cheaply checked, even before creating the FileStream (as the result of this might influence the `FileMode` etc. arguments).    A proposal is [in this commit](https://github.com/mstum/corefx/commit/a9dd5fe07e101807ea0a950ddf9edc9afc3d10ee).

27176	area-System.Net	Modify StreamContent to use default CopyToAsync buffer size when no size is provided	When creating `StreamContent`, users have the option to provide a buffer size or to use our default. This change attempts to improve performance by deferring to the default buffer size chosen in CopyToAsync rather than selecting the default ourselves.    The default buffer size in CopyToAsync is much larger than the default we chose in StreamContent. Deferring to that default greatly improves performance for uploads from slow stream sources like the file system. While it does add some cost for the initial allocation, the larger buffers are then pooled. Users are also still able to specify their own buffer size if they prefer not to use the default.    Some rough performance testing on my machine showed a ~20% decrease in the time it took HttpClient to upload a 20 MB file. That performance testing was based off the code in [this article](http://weblogs.thinktecture.com/pawel/2017/03/aspnet-core-webapi-performance.html), which was the source for the original issue.

If they don't differentiate then it can't write directly to the Pipe as writing a very small chunk followed by a flush in a loop would have an unacceptable performance degradation; so its back to maintaining internal arrays and then writing in a large chunk 😢     /cc @davidfowl @pakrym @stephentoub 
27167	area-System.Numerics	Add a special Numeric structure or INumeric Interface	_Intrinsic_ numeric types (byte, int, float, ….etc) are structures, so unfortunately, they have no base class that can gather all basic methods and operators!   So I suggest to add a special Numeric structure that can accept numeric values of any type. It should contain the value and the underling type of it, as Object class does. Numeric structure should have the basic arithmetic and logical operators. Or it can be an interace (say INumeric) that all numeric data types implement. This will not break any existing code.    Usage:   Numeric structure (or INumeric Inrerface) can be used in generic methods where T is expected to be a numeric type, to carry out the basic arithmetic and logical operators without writing a dozen if statements for each individual numeric type. Objects doesn't have the basic arithmetic and logical operators and have to be converted to numeric types to work with. For example, I tried to do this but failed:      ```    public struct Numeric      {          public object Value { get; set; }            public static Numeric operator +(Numeric n1, Numeric n2)          {              return (Numeric)(n1.Value + n2.Value);          }      }    ```  C# refuses n1.Value + n2.Value because it doesn't know how to add objects. Many if statements are needed to deal with different types of n1 and n2, regarding the larger type to use as the output type. This is a hell of code to something that should be easy and direct if there was a general numeric type that can contain any numeric type.    I face the same situation when I use the base Enum class in any method, because Enum can have any numeric type as an underling type!    I saw similar problem in the source code of Vector<T>, where tons of code lines are repeated just to cover all cases of each numeric type!    Note: If you add the numeric type, C# and VB.net should add a new constraint for generic parameters to be numerics.  where T: numeric  this means T can only be of type Numeric or any intrinsic numeric data types.    So, If this Numeric Type or INumeric Interface exists, one can write  ```  public static Enum SetFlag(Enum value, Enum flag)  {  var result = (Numeric)value | (Numeric)flag);  return (Enum)result;   }  ```    instead of:     ```  public static Enum SetFlags(Enum value, Enum flag)  {     if (Enum.GetUnderlyingType(value.GetType()) == typeof(byte))        return (Enum)(object)((byte)(object)value | (byte)(object)flag);       if (Enum.GetUnderlyingType(value.GetType()) == typeof(int))        return (Enum)(object)((int)(object)value | (int)(object)flag);      //     //     // etc  }  ```    and the same  when writing  generic types that deal with numeric data types only.  This can be extended based on this proposal https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/1233, I also suggest to add these interfaces:  numeric constraint.  IIntegral: for integer tyoes (byte, sbyte, int, uint, short, ushort, long, ulong)  IFloating: (float, double, decemal)  IValue: (numerics and dates).  ILetiral (Char and string).  IPrimitive (numerics, dates, char, string)    These Interfaces will make writting generics easier. IPerimative can help you   format or parsing or using + operation depending on where T: IPerimative.   Also it can be usefull when defining generic lists and dictionaries that can contain different values.  This will make them more specialized than using objects.

27164	area-Infrastructure	more love from BenchmarkDotNet to CoreFX	"To tell the long story short: I implemented new toolchain for BenchmarkDotNet which generates a self-contained app which can target **ANY** CoreFX and CoreCLR builds. I combined the knowledge from dogfooding docs from [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dogfooding.md) and [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/workflow/UsingDotNetCli.md). dotnet cli does the job for us, it's just a matter of generating the right `.csproj` and `NuGet.config` files.    So you can now:    1. Benchmark local CoreFX builds  2. Benchmark nightly CoreFX builds  3. Benchmark local CoreCLR builds  4. Benchmark nightly CoreCLR builds  5. Mix them all together  6. Compare them  7. Use Disassembly Diagnoser to get the generated assembly code    To use the new feature you need to add our CI feed to your `NuGet.config` file and download version `0.10.12.433` or newer.    ```xml  <packageSources>    <add key=""bdn-CI"" value=""https://ci.appveyor.com/nuget/benchmarkdotnet"" />  </packageSources>  ```    Simple example:    ```cs  public class LocalCoreFxConfig : ManualConfig  {   public LocalCoreFxConfig()   {    Add(Job.ShortRun.With(CustomCoreClrToolchain.CreateForLocalCoreFxBuild(     @""C:\Projects\forks\corefx\bin\packages\Release"",     ""4.5.0-preview2-26313-0"")));      Add(DefaultConfig.Instance.GetExporters().ToArray());    Add(DefaultConfig.Instance.GetLoggers().ToArray());    Add(DefaultConfig.Instance.GetColumnProviders().ToArray());      Add(DisassemblyDiagnoser.Create(new DisassemblyDiagnoserConfig(printAsm: true, recursiveDepth: 2)));   }  }    class Program  {      static void Main(string[] args)           => BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(Program).GetTypeInfo().Assembly)              .Run(args, new LocalCoreFxConfig());  }  ```    Comparison:    ```cs  Add(Job.Default.With(CustomCoreClrToolchain.CreateForNightlyCoreFxBuild(""4.5.0-preview2-26214-01"", displayName: ""before my change"")));  Add(Job.Default.With(CustomCoreClrToolchain.CreateForNightlyCoreFxBuild(""4.5.0-preview2-26215-01"", displayName: ""after my change"")));  ```    Complex example:    ```  public class LocalCoreClrConfig : ManualConfig  {   public LocalCoreClrConfig()   {    Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""local builds"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\coreclr\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.Release\.nuget\pkg"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26313-0"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\corefx\bin\packages\Release"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26313-0"")    ));      Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""local coreclr myget corefx"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\coreclr\bin\Product\Windows_NT.x64.Release\.nuget\pkg"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26313-0"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26215-01"")    ));      Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""myget coreclr local corefx"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26214-07"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: @""C:\Projects\forks\corefx\bin\packages\Release"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26313-0"")    ));      Add(Job.ShortRun.With(     new CustomCoreClrToolchain(      ""myget builds"",      coreClrNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreClrVersion: ""2.1.0-preview2-26214-07"",      coreFxNuGetFeed: ""https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-core/api/v3/index.json"",      coreFxVersion: ""4.5.0-preview2-26215-01"")    ));      // the rest of the config..   }  }  ```    The output is going to contain exact CoreCLR and CoreFX versions used:    ```  BenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.12.20180215-develop, OS=Windows 10 Redstone 3 [1709, Fall Creators Update] (10.0.16299.192)  Intel Core i7-3687U CPU 2.10GHz (Ivy Bridge), 1 CPU, 4 logical cores and 2 physical cores  Frequency=2533308 Hz, Resolution=394.7408 ns, Timer=TSC  .NET Core SDK=2.1.300-preview2-008162    [Host]     : .NET Core 2.0.5 (CoreCLR 4.6.26020.03, CoreFX 4.6.26018.01), 64bit RyuJIT    Job-DHYYZE : .NET Core ?

27161	area-System.Collections	ImmutableArray<byte> .Concat() includes a number of trailing zeroes not present in either argument	".NET Command Line Tools 2.0.2    Hello!  Found a weird problem today, been able to isolate it to the following code sample:    ```C#  using Newtonsoft.Json;  using System;  using System.Collections.Immutable;  using System.Linq;  using System.Text;    namespace ArraySanitycheck  {      class Program      {          public sealed class TestModel          {              public readonly string TestString;              public readonly int TestNumber;                public TestModel(string testString, int testNumber)              {                  TestString = testString;                  TestNumber = testNumber;              }          }            static void Main(string[] args)          {              var model = new TestModel(""Test String Content"", 268234);                var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($""Test Purpose\0{JsonConvert.SerializeObject(model)}"").ToImmutableArray();                var a = bytes.TakeWhile(i => i != 0);              var b = new byte[] { 0 };              var c = bytes.SkipWhile(i => i != 0).Skip(1).Take(5);              var d = new byte[] { 254 };              var e = bytes.SkipWhile(i => i != 0).Skip(6);              var concatenated = a.Concat(b).Concat(c).Concat(d).Concat(e);          }      }  }  ```    Set a breakpoint on the closing brace following `var concatenated...` and inspect `concatenated`.  It ends with approximately 15 zeroes.    Note that none of a, b, c, d or e include said zeroes.    Weirdly, attempting to write this data to the console (`Console.WriteLine(string.Join("", "", concatenated));`) does not include the zeroes either.      I suspect this may be an issue with how TakeWhile/SkipWhile perform ""slices"" of the underlying array (the length of the concatenated array is the same as the length of the sliced array)."

27124	area-System.Text	Regex code optimization candidates	The following items are potential candidates for code optimization which could result in an increased performance / reduced allocation. Based on perfview data and manual code review.    ### Time    - [x] Avoid additional iteration in op code generation (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/26877)  - [x] CharInClass (Internal & Recursive) (12.7% + 7.9% time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexCharClass.cs,787  comments from @danmosemsft: optimizing for common characters [A-Za-z] first? Bloom filter? It's doing a binary search over a short list  comments from myself: I think binary search shouldn't be an issue even for small classes. See this article: https://schani.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/linear-vs-binary-search/  - [x] Stringmatch (6.2 % time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs,256  Inline optimization for short case-sensitive strings (default).  `if (str[--c] != _culture.TextInfo.ToLower(runtext[--pos]))` check whether the characters are identical before doing ToLower  - [ ] SetOperator (5.4% time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs,148  Store a boolean whether either of those opcodes appear in the pattern at all. Reduces costs to a Boolean check only.  - [ ] Forwardcharnext (3.5% time spent exclusively)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexInterpreter.cs,249  The benchmark analyzed by perfview uses case sensitive comparison. I don't know why so much time is spent in this function when it only does two comparisons and an index operation.  - [ ] EnsureStorage (2.3% time spent exclusively, a lot of allocation is done here)  https://source.dot.net/#System.Text.RegularExpressions/System/Text/RegularExpressions/RegexRunner.cs,345  Though one of the functions is called Stack it's allocating arrays on the Heap. We should investigate how often these array sizes are increased and think about using stackalloc with Span/ValueListBuilder here.  - [x] Analyze failing inlinees  There are probably tons of other places where inline optimizations are applicable.  [System.Text.RegularExpression.Inline.xlsx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/files/1725897/System.Text.RegularExpression.Inline.xlsx)    ### Allocations    In regex-redux there are 3 huge sets of allocations that dominate the rest  - There is a cascade of replacements on a 50M character string, which creates 500MB of string garbage, presumably in LOH  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6385855/36403552-5d9591f0-159a-11e8-9dad-a0df6d71aeff.png)  - Its input file is read into a 100MB string.

If someone wants to collaborate I can share my perfview zip. I will extend this list over time.     FYI @stephentoub @jkotas @joshfree @vancem

27098	area-System.Runtime	.NET 4.7 -  '\0' char in String causes GetHashCode to ignore remainder -- but on x64 only	"@vsfeedback commented on [Mon Feb 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780)  The `GetHashCode(...)` function for the **ordinal** `String` comparisons In **.NET 4.7** has a grossly different behavior between running on **x86** versus **x64**. Note: ***I am not talking about the different hash code values, per-platform***, since these are intended as opaque -- rather, the issue here is a ***semantic difference*** in runtime behavior between the two platforms.    On **x86**, the full length of a `String` is always hashed, regardless of any `\0` characters.    On **x64**, the hashing terminates at the first `\0` character.    This is trivial to demonstrate:     var h1 = ""\0AAAAAAAAA"".GetHashCode();   var h2 = ""\0BBBBBBBBBBBB"".GetHashCode();   var h3 = ""\0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC"".GetHashCode();       // x64 results:   //  0x162a16fe   //  0x162a16fe   //  0x162a16fe       // x86 results:   //  0x07b801bc   //  0x048e22a3   //  0x21e2037d    As shown above, this affects the `GetHashCode` instance virtual method (overriden by the `String` type), as well as two other **.NET**-provided techniques for obtaining an ordinal-based `String` hash code: `StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode` and also `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.CompareInfo.GetHashCode` (when using `CompareOptions.Ordinal`). These results are summarized below:    <pre>  -------------------------- x86 --------------------------  &quot;\0AAAAAAAAA&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x07b801bc  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x07b801bc  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x07b801bc      &quot;\0BBBBBBBBBBBB&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x00001505  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x00001505  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x00001505      &quot;\0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x21e2037d  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x21e2037d  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x21e2037d          -------------------------- x64 --------------------------  &quot;\0AAAAAAAAA&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x162a16fe  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x162a16fe  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x162a16fe      &quot;\0BBBBBBBBBBBB&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x162a16fe  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x162a16fe  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x162a16fe      &quot;\0CCCCCCCCCCCCCCC&quot;  s.GetHashCode     0x162a16fe  StringComparer.Ordinal.GetHashCode  0x162a16fe  CompareInfo.GetHashCode/CompareOptions.Ordinal 0x162a16fe  </pre>    While I do realize that theoretical practice deems hash codes purely advisory, in practice applications will be designed to expect that hash code collisions are rare. Being able to trivially produce an infinite number of identical hashes, at will -- such as one can do via &quot;\0A&quot;, &quot;\0B&quot;, &quot;\0C&quot;, &quot;\012345...&quot;  (on **x64** all of these give the same hash code as above, `0x162a16fe`)-- is neither in the spirit of hashing nor accepted/expected common practice.    Worse, this only happens on the  x86 platform and not x64, which could cause considerable loss of design and development effort, if such proceeded based on a false impression of consistent behavior.    _This issue has been moved from https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/196675/net-47-0-char-in-string-causes-gethashcode-to-igno-1.html  VSTS ticketId: 565715_  _These are the original issue comments:_    Glenn Slayden on 2/9/2018, 06:39 PM (2 days ago): <p>I should also mention that the **x64** version of `String.GetHashCode(...)` in fact makes no reference to the string's length whatsoever, neither to incorporate that value into the hash, nor to determine how many characters to compute the hash code for. Instead, the x64 code ***just scans the string forward until it hits the first '\0' char***. If there are no embedded nulls, then it will scan to the end, where the **CLR** ensures there will always be an extra `\0` char (that is not included in the `Length`).</p><p>Thus, by ignoring the stored length of the string, the x64 code *takes a critical dependency* on that zero-terminating char being present. If that `\0` gets corrupted somehow, the failure mode is severe, since that loop can immediately scan off the end of the string into unrelated memory areas. </p><p>Since the **x86** version refers to the stored string length to determine how many chars to hash--it might seem like that code doesn't have the same problem, and it's true that it's not as fatal, as follows:</p><p>The x86 code does actually take a ***different kind of dependency*** on the zero terminator, namely, that loop is written such that the 16-bit terminator value itself is `XORed` into the returned hash value whenever the two lowest bits of the input string length are equal to `0b_00000011 == 0x03`. For that operation to have no effect, the terminator must be zero (since `xor` with zero is a `nop`.)  So if the terminator somehow becomes corrupted, the returned hash code value will be affected, but there won't likely be an immediate `AccessViolationException` (as with the x64 case).</p>    _These are the original issue solutions:_  (no solutions)  ---  @Joe4evr commented on [Mon Feb 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365098562)  Curious, does this also repro for the `OrdinalIgnoreCase` variants?  ---  @jcouv commented on [Mon Feb 12 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365161086)  @AlexGhiondea Could you help route?

The problem is with MSIL code that exists in the `String.GetHashCode` function in mscorlib.dll. The difference between **x64** and **x86** is due to there being different mscorlib.dll builds for each.    ---  @glenn-slayden commented on [Tue Feb 13 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365370873)  @jinujoseph  The 'Area-IDE' tag doesn't sound right; as I mentioned the problem is with runtime code in the Base Class Library.  ---  @jcouv commented on [Tue Feb 13 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/24780#issuecomment-365374965)  I'll move the issue over to corefx  "

Several related changes:  (1) Move nonessential code out of LoopbackServer itself. E.g. the websocket test code and the ""transfer"" code. These are only used by a couple very specific tests, and don't actually need to be in LoopbackServer.  (2) Simplify a few things that are awkward today. For example, the Options object gets passed in to several different places and used in different ways. I changed it to only be passed in to CreateServerAsync. Another example: the callback you pass to AcceptSocketAsync always has to return a Task<List>, even though many uses don't care about this and just pass null.  (3) Add the Connection object, which makes the callback from AcceptSocketAsync (now AcceptConnectionAsync) cleaner. Today you have to have four params on the callback, even though you often only care about one or two. Connection just encapsulates these args into a single object, and allows you to easily discover and call instance methods on this object.  (4) Rename some core methods to make them more descriptive.  (5) Fix usage in tests to reflect the updates.    @stephentoub @davidsh @Priya91 @wfurt     "
27086	area-Infrastructure	Tests are not waiting on child processes when run	Some tests use RemoteInvoke to launch child processes. Generally they should call Dispose() on the RemoteInvokeHandle that returns in order to WaitForExit on the process. If they forget, execution will continue and any assertion failure (or other unhandled exception) in the child process will not prevent the test passing. Eg.,:  ```    Running tests...

End time=22:29:15.68, Exit code = 0  ```    This behavior is slightly obscured when running on a dev machine, as runtests.cmd is generally wrapped inside MSBuild, and MSBuild, after WaitforExit hsa returned on the process it launched, will then wait indefinitely for the console output streams to reach EOF. Those do not return until the grandchild remote processes have exited (@JeremyKuhne @stephentoub  I'm unclear why this is - do they automatically duplicate the console handles from the test process which is MSBuild's direct child?). When the grandchild fails in this situation, the exception will appear in the console, but the test will already have succeeded and be counted as such.    When Helix runs the tests using runtest.cmd directly, MSBuild is not involved so if Dispose() is forgotten there is no wait on the grandchildren and they are completely ignored. https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/26543#issuecomment-365021333 is an example.    We should add a finalizer to RemoteInvokeHandle which will mean that at least some waiting will occur on those child processes: they still wont fail the test, as it's too late, but their console output is more likely to show up in the log. (XUnit does not do WaitForPendingFinalizers so I figure if they don't complete within X seconds - I think 40 seconds - of the XUnit process completing, the output still won't show up.)    @stephentoub  does this sound like the best we can do?

27075	area-System.Data	ADO.NET: Database-independent way to generate parameter placeholders	In theory, parameter placeholders [are an entirely database-specific details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/configuring-parameters-and-parameter-data-types#working-with-parameter-placeholders) - there is no way to write a single SQL containing parameters, and then execute it on different databases.    In practice, it seems that most ADO.NET have aligned on the `@name` convention. This is quite a problem, since for databases which don't support it natively, the ADO.NET provider must parse and replace the `@name` placeholder with the one accepted by the database. For example, PostgreSQL uses positional placeholders ($1, $2...), which by the way are also specific to individual statements in a batch (parameters are per-statement, not per-batch).    We could design an API where the provider would generate the placeholder. This could be as simple as adding a `Placeholder` property on DbParameter, which each provider would implement as necessary. The user would then interpolate the placeholder into the CommandText. For positional placeholders, the logic would typically calculate the placeholder as the DbParameter is inserted into a DbParameterCollection, whereas for named placeholders the `ParameterName` would be returned.

27069	area-System.Net	Cache SslClientAuthenticationOptions on SocketsHttpHandler pool	For the common case, we can just use a singleton cached instance with settings computed when the pool is created.  Only if it's accessed via HttpClientHandler with a server certificate callback do we need to still create an instance per request, in order to wrap the delegate to provide the expected semantics.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @Priya91, @wfurt 
27068	area-System.Net	Fix SocketsHttpHandler connection pool accounting for dropped connections	When MaxConnectionsPerServer is set to anything other than int.MaxValue, the SocketsHttpHandler pool keeps track of the number of connections handed out, and this count is updated when a connection is disposed.  But if a response stream isn't disposed of, resulting in the connection never being disposed of, the count may never be updated.  This fix adds an HttpConnection derived type that simply adds a finalizer, making it pay-for-play when MaxConnectionsPerServer is set to something other than the default.    cc: @geoffkizer, @davidsh, @Priya91, @wfurt 
27067	area-System.Net	WinHttpHandler/CurlHandler hangs or fails when connection pooling and connection dropped	See GetAsync_DontDisposeResponse_EventuallyUnblocksWaiters test.  It sets MaxConnectionsPerServer to 1, and then proceeds to issue a ResponseHeadersRead request but drops the response object without disposing it.  It then creates a second request to the same server, and that request is never processed.

27065	area-System.Net	Test failure: GetAsync_CancelPendingRequests_DoesntCancelReadAsyncOnResponseStream	CurlHandler incorrectly maintains a registration with the CancellationToken passed in to SendAsync for the duration of the whole operation, including processing of the response body, even if HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead is used.  That means that HttpClient.CancelAllPending will cancel such operations.  It should unregister from that token once it completes the Task returned from SendAsync.

27063	area-System.Net	Test failure: PostAsync_CancelDuringRequestContentSend_TaskCanceledQuickly	WinHttpHandler has some cancellation support, but it doesn't appear to support cancellation during content send, e.g. if cancellation is requested and the server never sends back response headers.  netfx has the same issue.

Calling Win32 APIs with paths normally will strip these. The exception is when prepended with `\\?\`.  We purposefully do not handle creating these unless you use `\\?\` as creating these sort of paths frequently breaks apps.  We should (and do) handle finding them via `GetFiles`, etc. and handle manipulating them with the *Info classes. We currently don't allow opening them directly from a path string unless you use `\\?\`.

27044	area-Microsoft.CSharp	Make many helpers, factories and tables static in Microsoft.CSharp	Microsoft.CSharp has several objects that are heavily used throughout the library that have circular dependencies on each other, as well as several other classes depending on them. Use of them hence requires either a field in each object that will use them, or to follow chains of such fields. Prior to #25191 it was necessary for them to be instances so that they could be replaced with new versions. This no longer being necessary it's possible to make them all static.    At the same time, the related `RuntimeBinder`, `ExpressionBinder` and `BindingContext` classes are relatively heavy, mostly due to these dependencies. They are hence created once unless a cast must be attempted with a different `BindingContext`, and `BindingContext`'s state is overwritten for each operation. Removing these dependencies makes these very light, allowing them to be `readonly struct`s that are created for each operation.    * Have `TypeArray` in charge of the empty `TypeArray` singleton    * Make `TypeArray` allocation a static responsibility of `TypeArray`    * Remove some orphaned members.    Mostly `BSYMMGR`-returning members that had been used to allocate `TypeArrays`    * Make members static where possible.    Those that can already be easily made static. Includes removing some members that this makes no longer necessary.    * Remove unused parameters    Since some are of the types we'll be making static, and such parameters will have to go anyway.    * Make `TypeTable` static    And more conventional names within `TypeTable`.    * More `TypeManager` state & methods to static    * Make `SYMTBL.Key` an immutable struct.    * `SYMTBL` completely static and renamed to `SymbolStore`    More conventional name, and doesn't clash with other `SymbolTable` class.    * `GetWinRTCollectionIfacesAll` to property.    * `SymFactory` static class.    * Remove `PredefinedTypes._symbolManager` field    Only used in assertion.    * Remove assert comparison with this in `GetAggregate`    Assert is the only reason to not be static, allows a cascade of more changes to static.    * Make `InternalsVisibleTo` check static.    * Make cycle of instance methods static    Take quite a large set of methods which must be instance because of cyclic instance dependencies, and make them all static.    Removes dependency in `AggregateSymbol` and `NullableType` on `TypeManager` instances.    * Replace `GetAggTypeSym` with virtual method on `CType`.    Merged with existing `GetAts` on `NullableType`. Comment says this would be nice, and indeed it would, and its easy now.    * Make those members that can now be static, static.    * Remove orphaned members and fields.    * `PredefinedMembers` entirely static.    * Remove `UserStringBuilder.m_buildingInProgress`    Only used in asserts, just assert on whether `m_strBuilder` is null or not.    Also rename `m_strBuilder` to `_strBuilder` to be more conventional.    * Favour returning over out in `UserStringBuilder`    And favour clearing `StringBuilder` over creating another.    * Make `ErrorHandling` completely static.    Creating `UserStringBuilder` instances on demand.    * `TypeManager` static.    * Make `CNullable` methods static and merge directly into `ExpressionBinder`    Don't cache method and property, as they're already cached.    * Don't preload types.    Either they'll be loaded soon anyway, or else it's a wasted effort.    * Move `CompareTypes` into Better.cs    * Remove `BSYMMGR.LookupAggMember`    Just call into `SymbolStore.LookupSym`    * Move `LookupNextSym` logic into `Symbol`    * Remove `BSYMMGR` and `GlobalSymbolContext`    No longer any use.    * `ExprFactory` static    * `SymbolLoader` static    * `CSemanticChecker` static    * Don't pre-emptively load `System.Object`    Will be loaded as a base of the first type encountered anyway.    * `SymbolTable` static    * More methods can be made static    * Remove orphaned method.    * Move methods for getting `MemberInfo`s from expressions into those expressions    * Replace `ExpressionTreeCallRewriter.GetObject` with virtual property in `Expr`    * `TypeArray` tidy-up.    * Pass `ExpressionBinder` to operator delegates, and make them static.    Allows array to be created once statically, rather than on each instance construction.    * Create `RuntimeBinder`, `ExpressionBinder` and `BindingContext` per operation    These are now very lightweight, so it's simpler to create them anew each time rather than overwriting the values in the `BindingContext`.    * Make `RuntimeBinder`, `ExpressionBinder` and `BindingContext` structs    No need to allocate on the heap.    * Remove `AggregateDeclaration`    We only ever care about the `AggregateSymbol` it relates to.    (The two aren't really separate in dynamic code, where there aren't really declarations).    * Remove `IsChecked` and `CallingContext` from C# binders.    Now not used as they are passed to `RuntimeBinder` on construction, except for `CallingContext` remaining in `CSharpInvokeMemberBinder` for use in deferring.    * Make `RecordBinOpSigFromArgs` static.    A last member that can be made static.    CC @VSadov @OmarTawfik

27033	area-System.Numerics	[Feature-Request] N-bit sized int and floating point types	@hamarb123 commented on [Fri Feb 09 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/647)  I propose we should be able to have N-bit sized int and floating point types.  Here is how it could work:    Obviously we already have the following:  - int 1 / uint 1 (bool)  - uint 8 (byte)  - int 8 (sbyte)  - uint 16, 32 and 64 (ushort, uint and ulong)  - int 16, 32 and 64 (short, int and long)  - float 32 (single)  - float 64 (double)    But what about the following:  - (u)int 2 (2 bits)  - (u)int 4 (4 bits)  - (u)int 128 (128 bits)  - (u)int 256 (256 bits)  - (u)int 2^n (2^n bits)  - (float 1 makes no sense but you could still add it)  - float 2 (2 bits)  - float 4 (4 bits)  - float 8 (8 bits)  - float 16 (16 bits)  - float 128 (128 bits)  - float 256 (256 bits)  - float 2^n (2^n bits)    The classes could be called the following:  For integers: `intj` where j is a power of 2 for a j bit integer  For unsigned integers: `uintj` where j is a power of 2 for a j bit unsigned integer  For floats: `floatj` where j is a power of 2 for a j bit float  And there could be special names for floats between `float8` and `float256` ranging from `quarter`, `half`, `single` (already in .NET), `double` (already in .NET), `quadruple`, `octuple`    Why do I need this in my beloved c#?  1. Because it will give you more/less precise floats to use  2. It will give you more integers to use  3. There are no good floating point (bigger than double) libraries out there that do not just use System.Math which reduces it to double precision anyway    Won't this ruin my IDE with millions of different type names?  1. Not if you make a maximum for the types (say 1024) or make it so that the IDE can have the ability to only show you some (say up to 1024) then it will not give you millions of types suggested  
27031	area-System.Net	SocketsHttpHandler should check for transfer encoding chunked without content	WinHttpHandler and CurlHandler both fail if TransferEncodingChunked is set to true but request.Content is null.  SocketsHttpHandler should check for that, too.  And there should be a test.
27029	area-System.Net	Enable SocketsHttpHandler cancellation support	This change significantly improves the cancellation support in SocketsHttpHandler.  Previously we were passing the CancellationToken around to every method, eventually bottoming out in calls to the underlying Stream which then ends up passing them down to the underlying Socket.  But today Socket's support for cancellation is minimal, only doing up-front checks; if cancellation is requested during the socket operation rather than before, the request will be ignored.  Since HttpClient implements features like timeouts on top of cancellation support, it's important to do better than this.    The change implements cancellation by registering with the CancellationToken to dispose of the connection.  This will cause any reads/writes to wake up.  We then translate resulting exceptions into cancellation exceptions.  When in the main SendAsync method, we register once for the whole body of the operation until the point that we're returning the response message.  For individual operations on the response content stream, we register per operation; however, when feasible we try to avoid the registration costs by only registering if operations don't complete synchronously.  We also account for the case that on Unix, closing the connection may result in read operations waking up not with an exception but rather with EOF, which we also need to translate into cancellation when appropriate.    Along the way I cleaned up a few minor issues as well.    I also added a bunch of cancellation-related tests:  - Test cancellation occurring while sending request content  - Test cancellation occurring while receiving response headers  - Test cancellation occurring while receiving response body and using a buffered operation  - Test that all of the above are triggerable with CancellationTokenSource.Cancel, HttpClient.CancelPendingRequests, and HttpClient.Dispose  - Test cancellation occurring while receiving response body and using an unbuffered operation, either a ReadAsync or CopyToAsync on the response stream  - Test that a CancelPendingRequests doesn't affect unbuffered operations on the response stream    There are deficiencies here in the existing handlers, and tests have been selectively disabled accordingly.  SocketsHttpHandler passes now for all of them.  I will open issues for the non-netfx issues and include the corresponding numbers in comments before merging.    cc: @geoffkizer, @Priya91, @wfurt, @davidsh   Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23131  Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/23141

That media type does not specify a `charset` parameter, which is unconditionally added in this class.    Adding this parameter automatically is probably not a good idea. I'm not sure the right fix, I just know that `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8` will choke some parsers.
27014	area-System.Numerics	Add Vector.Narrow and Vector.Widen overloads to cast elemnts values between float and int, and between double and long	I suggest to add these two overloads to the Vector.Narrow method:  ```  Vector<int> Vector.Narrow(Vector<float>, ConversionType ct)  Vector<long> Vector.Narrow(Vector<double> ConversionType ct)    ```  where:  ```  enum ConversionType  {      Floor,        // Apply Mathf.Floor      Ceiling,     // Apply Mathf.Ceiling      Truncate,   // Apply Mathf.Truncate      Round       // Apply Mathf.Round  }    ```  Example:  ```  var v1 = new Vector<float>({-1.4, 2.1, -3.9, 4.3});  var v2 = Vector.Narrow(v1, ConversionType.Floor);        // <-2, 2, -4, 4>    ```  By the way, It will be nice if we can use foreach to iterate Vector<T> elemnts using foreach..  I think more mathematical methods (like the ones in the Math class) can be added to the Vector class. The fact that the Vector<T> is immutable, demands some long codes to construct a new version containing individual results. Or, is there a chance to make the Indexer read-write?

Here's the test case:        [TestMethod]      public void TestTypeLoadingWithFilePath()      {          var originalType = typeof(SomeClass);          var assemblyAddress = originalType.Assembly.Location;            var loadedAssembly = Assembly.LoadFile(assemblyAddress);          Assert.IsNotNull(loadedAssembly);            var loadedType = loadedAssembly.GetType(originalType.FullName);          Assert.IsNotNull(loadedType);            Assert.AreEqual(originalType, loadedType);      }    The test fails on the last assertion.    This only happens on .NET Core on Windows. (I'm testing against latest version, 2.1.4). But this was not the case with .NET Framework.    Is this by design, or a bug?  If it's by design, why?  Again, if it's by design, doesn't this mean different behavior between two implementations of .NET Standard? (.NET Core vs. .NET Framework)
27001	area-System.Memory	API proposal: ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>	## Summary    This proposal simplifies the use of disposable resources shared through code where single owner of the resource is either unclear, or complicates maintenance of the code. This situation is increasingly common when asynchronous code which needs to operate on a threading-agnostic API where the `Dispose` operation is explicitly called out as not safe for concurrent use.    The semantics of a safe, shared wrapper for `IDisposable` objects is challenging, especially when considerations are made for handling missing and/or multiple calls to `Dispose` and for weakly-held references. Providing a holder for managing lifetimes of these objects allows developers to focus on the semantics of the underlying shared object, which is always a challenge in itself.    ## Proposed API    ```csharp  namespace System.Memory  {    public sealed class ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> : IDisposable      where T : class, IDisposable    {      public ReferenceCountedDisposable(T instance);        public T Target { get; }        public ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> TryAddReference();      public void Dispose();        public struct WeakReference      {        public WeakReference(ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> reference);          public ReferenceCountedDisposable<T> TryAddReference();      }    }  }  ```    ## Semantics    A reference-counting wrapper which allows multiple uses of a single disposable object in code, which is deterministically released (by calling `IDisposable.Dispose`) when the last reference is disposed.    Each instance of `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` represents a counted reference (also referred to as a *reference* in the following documentation) to a target object. Each of these references has a lifetime, starting when it is constructed and continuing through its release. During this time, the reference is considered *alive*. Each reference which is alive owns exactly one reference to the target object, ensuring that it will not be disposed while still in use. A reference is released through either of the following actions:    * The reference is explicitly released by a call to `Dispose`.  * The reference is no longer in use by managed code and gets reclaimed by the garbage collector.    While each instance of `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` should be explicitly disposed when the object is no longer needed by the code owning the reference, this implementation will not leak resources in the event one or more callers fail to do so. When all references to an object are explicitly released (i.e. by calling `Dispose`), the target object will itself be deterministically released by a call to `IDisposable.Dispose` when the last reference to it is released. However, in the event one or more references is not explicitly released, the underlying object will still become eligible for non-deterministic release (i.e. finalization) as soon as each reference to it is released by one of the two actions described previously.    When using `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>`, certain steps must be taken to ensure the target object is not disposed early.    1. Use `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` consistently. In other words, do not mix code using reference-counted wrappers with code that references to the target directly.  1. Only use the `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>(T reference)` constructor one time per target object. Additional references to the same target object must only be obtained by calling `TryAddReference`.  1. Do not call `IDisposable.Dispose` on the target object directly. It will be called automatically at the appropriate time, as described above.    All public methods on this type adhere to their pre- and post-conditions and will not invalidate state even in concurrent execution.    ### `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.TryAddReference`    Increments the reference count for the disposable object, and returns a new disposable reference to it. The returned object is an independent reference to the same underlying object. Disposing of the returned value multiple times will only cause the reference count to be decreased once.    Return value: a new `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` pointing to the same underlying object, if it has not yet been disposed; otherwise, `null` if this reference to the underlying object has already been disposed.    ### `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.WeakReference`    Represents a weak reference to a `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>` which is capable of obtaining a new counted reference up until the point when the object is no longer accessible.    ### Differences between `TryAddReference` operations    The semantics of `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.TryAddReference` and `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.WeakReference.TryAddReference` are slightly different:    * `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.TryAddReference`: This method returns `null` after *this reference* is disposed. In other words, it is possible for other references to the target object to still be held in code.  * `ReferenceCountedDisposable<T>.WeakReference.TryAddReference`: This method returns `null` after *the last reference* to the target object is disposed.

26995	area-System.Net	Add DecompressionMethods.Brotli?	"System.Net.DecompressionMethods is an enum that is used by HttpClient handlers to determine whether/what to automatically decode in a response, e.g. if DecompressionMethods.Deflate is set and the response is encoded with deflate, it'll automatically decode the response as part of handing it back.    The enum today is just:  ```C#  namespace System.Net  {      [Flags]      public enum DecompressionMethods      {          None = 0,          GZip = 1,          Deflate = 2      }  }  ```  but we now also have BrotliStream, which we could use to support a DecompressionMethods.Brotli and a ""br"" encoding:  ```C#  namespace System.Net  {      [Flags]      public enum DecompressionMethods      {          ...          Brotli = 4      }  }  ```  From an implementation perspective, this would mean either System.Net.Http.dll taking a dependency on System.IO.Compression.Brotli.dll, or if we wanted to avoid the dependency, building all of the source into System.Net.Http.dll (there is currently a native dependency, with the native portion compiled into clrcompression.dll on Windows and System.IO.Compression.Native.so/dylib on Unix)."

Windows 2008 R2  ```  [headers] => Array  (      [Connection] => Keep-Alive      [Host] => scooterlabs.com  )  ```    Windows 10  ```  [headers] => Array  (      [Connection] => Keep-Alive      [Accept-Encoding] => gzip, deflate      [Host] => scooterlabs.com  )    ```  This works as expected on a Windows 10 box and Windows 8.1 VM.    If you force the headers to be sent however, on Windows 2008 R2 it decompresses fine, so compression is supported.    If you use WebClient or HttpWebRequest directly with `AutomaticDecompression` set it works on all versions with the correct headers and ability to handle the compressed payload.    This works on all environments  ```csharp  var handler = new HttpClientHandler()  {         AutomaticDecompression = DecompressionMethods.GZip | DecompressionMethods.Deflate  };    using (var client = new HttpClient(handler))  {        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue(""gzip""));        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.AcceptEncoding.Add(new StringWithQualityHeaderValue(""deflate""));        response = client.GetStringAsync(""http://scooterlabs.com/echo"").Result;  }  ```      P/s: SO question is here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48703143/httpclient-not-sending-accept-encoding-on-different-machine    "

26976	area-System.Reflection	Add support for PDB Checksum debug directory entry	Implements proposal https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/26935    The CodeView debug directory entry in PE/COFF file associates the PE file with one or more PDBs. The CodeView entry and the PDB both store the same PDB ID (for Portable PDB it's 20B for Windows PDB it's 16B of data). Debuggers, symbol servers and other tools use the PDB ID to match the PE file with the PDB.     Although the PDB ID is good enough for finding the right PDB for the PE file it is not good enough for validating that the PDB has not been maliciously modified. _PDB Checksum_ is a new debug directory record that can be used for such validation.    _PDB Checksum_ comprises of crypto hash algorithm name and the hash of the PDB content. See   [Specification](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Reflection.Metadata/specs/PE-COFF.md#pdb-checksum-debug-directory-entry-type-19) for details.

26956	area-System.Numerics	Add Quaternion.Divide(Quaternion, float)	I noticed that Quaternion.Divide Method has no overload to dived a quaternion by a scalar value, unlike the Multiply method! so I suggest to add it!  I used this:  ```  Dim Q1 = New Quaternion(1, -1, 2, -4)  Dim Q2 = New Quaternion(-1, 1, -2, -4) * (1 / Q1.LengthSquared())  ```    Edit:  After looking at the Inverse Methode source code, it appears it is the Reciprocal Method but with a confusing name! Inverse in math can mean addative Inverse  or multiplicative inverse. SIMD-enabled types are not consistant with naming conventions of .net. One odd examole is implementing the Length of these types as a method not a property! I expected to find a Quaternion.Reciprocal as there is a Complex.Reciprocal, but found an Inverse method instead. Having a consistant naming convention makes new features easy to learn and thier methods names easy to remember.  Also I think many of static members need to be instance members.
26954	area-System.Runtime	Proposal: TryForSufficientStack method to support stackalloc usage	"_From @kkokosa on February 8, 2018 12:8_  Due to changes in C# 7.2 and Span, more and more `stackalloc `usages may become popular like:    `Span<byte> span = stackalloc byte[1000];`    However, this call will end up with unrecoverable `StackOverflowException `if there is not enough stack space left. We can do nothing in such situation which makes this approach not useful at some point. It is now just completely unreliable to guess what `stackalloc `size may end up with such a catastrophe.    @jkotas pointed out in #14675 that `RuntimeHelpers.EnsureSufficientExecutionStack` is a reliable solution for handling stack overflow in general but as MSDN says, this method ""_ensures that the remaining stack space is large enough to execute the average .NET Framework function_"". However, probing for _average_ .NET framework function is not very helpful as `stackalloc` makes it not average for sure.     I propose to add a new helper method which gives at least some clue whether our `stackalloc `may end up with `StackOverflowException`:    `public static bool RuntimeHelpers.TryForSufficientStack(long size)`    I believe returning `bool` instead of throwing an exception (like `InsufficientExecutionStackException` from above method) is better because `stackalloc` is most probably used in hot paths already and adding exception handling there is rather undesirable.    As far as I understand this method seems to be quite simple in terms of implementation as all necessary data are there already. My naive implementation proposal:    ```  FCIMPL1(FC_BOOL_RET, ReflectionInvocation::TryForSufficientStack, INT64 size)  {      FCALL_CONTRACT;        Thread *pThread = GetThread();        UINT_PTR current = reinterpret_cast<UINT_PTR>(&pThread);      UINT_PTR limit = reinterpret_cast<UINT_PTR>(pThread->GetCachedStackLimit());        FC_RETURN_BOOL(current >= (limit + size));  }  FCIMPLEND  ```    PS. I am not sure whether stack guard size should be taken into consideration here or not...   _Copied from original issue: dotnet/coreclr#16277_"
